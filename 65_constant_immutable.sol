****CONSTANT****
All the instances of the variables are replaced with value. 
Replacement is done during compilation.
There will not be a storage allocation, as there will be only value.
Value type variables and STRINGS can have "constant" keyword. No array, struct,...
Variable name should be CAPITAL

****IMMUTABLE****
All the instances of the variables are replaced with value. 
Replacement is done during construction. 
There will not be a storage allocation, as there will be only value.
Only 32 bytes are reserved for this. For this reason, only Value type variables can have "immutable" keyword. No string, array, struct,...
